# Here's what I've learned while develop an interactive calendar on ReactJs without helped  momentJs and date-fns. 
It wasn’t easy, but it was so interesting)

## 1. I understand now, how to use native Date object from JS and how to manipulate date.
For example:
- Do you know the first day of the week is Sunday? Ofcourse yes, you can say me. But i’m used to the frist day of the week is Monday. And when i called getDay() method from instance Date i was surprised.

## 2. I understand now, how to use RTK Query from redux-toolkit.
Actually i used redux-toolkit in my projects. But, I have always been interested in how to use  RTK Query and what’s a request caching.

After ending development, i understand where i can use RTK Query or async-thunk-action for best performance. 

## 3. I understand now, how to forget  create-react-app and not using webpack for  development my projects. Instead of  Webpack i choiced Vite. Ofcourse, i know Webpack 4 and  Webpack 5 with module federation)

## 4. I understand now, how to use variables from theme’s pallet and  how to develop custom components which based on MUI and styled-components

Actually, you can say what’s problem? 
And i can say - you have to understanding the material design and base principles) i think it’s not so easy when you're not a designer

## 5. I understand now, how to important to encapsulate a complex logic in custom hooks.
Using useEffect for everything it’s not right way to control a component’s state. Now I'm thinking more and more about importance of custom hooks and their names.

## 6. I understand now, how to support multiple languages using i18next.
## 7. I understand now, how to simplify a action-thunk management using a pattern bindActionCreators.

It’s easy when you understaing a problem whit lots of  action-thunks and do you want to encapsulate the dispatch call.

Just see  useActionCreators (https://github.com/rv-ivanushkin/calendar-interactive/blob/main/src/hooks/index.ts)

## 8. I understand now, how to important using TypeScript and base  TypeScript’s utils
## 9. I understand now, how to simplify develop interesting UI with styled-components and CSS Grid
